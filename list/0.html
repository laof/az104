						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Correct Option: C. Assign tags to the virtual machines.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Explanation: <b>Tags</b> are a way to organize resources in Azure by applying metadata to them. By assigning tags to the virtual machines, you can associate each VM with its respective department, making it easier to manage and filter resources based on these tags.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Create Azure Management Groups for each department:</b> Management Groups are used to manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions. They are not intended for organizing resources within a single subscription.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. Create a resource group for each department:</b> Resource groups are used to manage and organize resources within an Azure subscription. However, since all VMs are already located in RG1, creating additional resource groups would not be the most efficient way to associate VMs with departments.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D. Modify the settings of the virtual machines:</b> Modifying VM settings does not provide a structured way to associate VMs with departments. Tags are a more effective and organized method for this purpose.</span></div></div></div>
