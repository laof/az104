						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Correct Answer:</h4>A.. <b>Select the custom role and add Sub1 and Sub2 to the assignable scopes. Remove RG1 from the assignable scopes.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> To apply a custom role across all resource groups in both <b>Sub1</b> and <b>Sub2</b>, you must set the <b>assignable scopes</b> of the role to the subscription level for both subscriptions. This allows the role to be assigned to any resource group within those subscriptions. Removing <b>RG1</b> from the assignable scopes ensures the role is not limited to just that resource group. This approach also <b>minimizes administrative effort</b> by using a single role definition.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Other Options:</h4>B.. Create a new custom role for Sub1. Create a new custom role for Sub2. Remove the role from RG1.<div lova></div><div lova></div>This works but increases administrative overhead by maintaining two separate roles instead of one.<div lova></div><div lova></div>C.. Create a new custom role for Sub1 and add Sub2 to the assignable scopes. Remove the role from RG1.<div lova></div><div lova></div>This is contradictoryâ€”creating a new role for Sub1 and adding Sub2 to its scope is not logically consistent. Also, it implies creating a new role unnecessarily.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D.. Select the custom role and add Sub1 to the assignable scopes. Remove RG1 from the assignable scopes. Create a new custom role for Sub2.<div lova></div><div lova></div>This again results in two roles, increasing administrative effort, which goes against the requirement to minimize it.</span></div></div></div>
