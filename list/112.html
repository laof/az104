Also, a <b>Microsoft 365 group</b> like Group3 <b>cannot</b> be added to a security group like Group1. However, since Group3 is marked as <b>role-assignable</b>, assigning the Owner role directly to Group3 for RG1 will grant User3 the Owner role.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Other Options:</h4>You can assign User2 the Owner role for RG1 by adding Group2 as a member of Group1. — <b>No</b>.
