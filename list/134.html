						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Answer:</h4><b>No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Correct Option:</h4><b>B. No</b><div lova></div>The <b>New-MgUser</b> cmdlet is primarily used to create internal users and requires manual configuration of all guest user properties. It does not automatically handle guest invitations or send emails. The correct and recommended approach for inviting external users is to use the <b>New-MgInvitation</b> cmdlet, which simplifies the process by setting <b>UserType</b> to <b>Guest</b>, sending an invitation email, and requiring minimal input. This makes it the feasible and scalable solution for onboarding 500 external users from a CSV file.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Incorrect Option:</h4><b>A. Yes</b><div lova></div>This is incorrect because although <b>New-MgUser</b> can technically create guest users, it is not designed for that purpose and lacks the automation and simplicity provided by <b>New-MgInvitation</b>, making it impractical for bulk guest onboarding.</span></div></div></div>
