						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>The first thing you should do is:</h4>A..From the RSV1 blade, click Backup items and stop the VM2 backup<div lova></div><h4><div lova></div>-----------------</h4><h4><div lova></div>Explanations of right option:</h4><b>A..From the RSV1 blade, click Backup items and stop the VM2 backup</b>: An Azure VM can only be backed up to one Recovery Services vault at a time. Before you can back up VM2 to RSV2, you must first stop (remove) the backup of VM2 from RSV1.<div lova></div><h4><div lova></div>-----------------</h4><h4><div lova></div>Explanation of other options:</h4>B..From the RSV2 blade, click Backup. From the Backup blade, select the backup for the virtual machine, and then click Backup: You cannot configure a new backup for a VM in a new vault (RSV2) while it is still being backed up in another vault (RSV1).<div lova></div>C..From the VM2 blade, click Disaster recovery, click Replication settings, and then select RSV2 as the Recovery Services vault: This option is for disaster recovery (replication), not backup.<div lova></div>D..From the RSV1 blade, click Backup Jobs and export the VM2 job: Exporting backup jobs does not move or stop the backup for VM2; you must stop the backup before configuring a new one in RSV2.<h4><div lova></div>If you want to change the recovery service vault you need to dissociate the previous RSV and delete the backup data. To delete backup data, you need to <b>stop the backup first</b>.<div lova></div>So:</h4>1. Stop the backup in RSV1 (D)<div lova></div>2. Remove the backup data.<div lova></div>3. Disassociate the VM in RSV1.<div lova></div>4. Associate the VM in RSV2.</span></div></div></div>
