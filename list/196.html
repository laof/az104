Dep1File1.docx was last modified on October 2. By October 10, it has not been modified for 8 days; Rule1 says if not modified for 2 days, move to archive, and if not modified for 9 days, delete. On October 10, it's not deleted yet, but it is in the <b>archive tier</b>, which means it cannot be read unless rehydrated.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Yes</b><div lova></div>for File2.docx: <b>Rule2</b> applies to all blobs. File2.docx was last modified on October 5, so by October 10, it's only 5 days old. Rule2 moves blobs to cool storage after 3 days and archive after 9 days, so File2.docx is in <b>cool storage</b> and can still be read.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Yes</b><div lova></div>for File3.docx: <b>Rule2</b> applies. File3.docx was last modified on October 2, so by October 10, it's 8 days old. It would have been moved to cool storage after 3 days, but not yet to archive (that happens at 9 days). It can still be read.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of other options:</b><div lova></div>Yes for Dep1File1.docx – Incorrect, because it is in archive tier and can't be read directly.<div lova></div>No for File2.docx – Incorrect, because File2.docx is only in cool storage and can be read.<div lova></div>No for File3.docx – Incorrect, because File3.docx is also only in cool storage and can be read.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
