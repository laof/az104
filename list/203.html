Rule1 moves it to <b>Archive</b> after 3 days (June 4), and Rule2 moves blobs older than 5 days to <b>Cool</b> storage, but by June 6, File1 has already been moved to Archive by Rule1. So, File1 will not be in the Cool tier on June 6.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Statement 2: No</b>: File2 is in <b>container2</b> and starts in the Hot tier on June 1; there is no rule to move it to Cool on June 1. No lifecycle management rule applies to move it to Cool on that day.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Statement 3: No</b>: File2 is in <b>container2</b>. Rule3 will delete File2 after 10 days (June 11), so by June 16, File2 will have already been deleted and cannot be in the Archive tier.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Statement 1: Yes</b>: <b>Incorrect</b>. File1 is moved to Archive on June 4 and cannot be in the Cool tier on June 6.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Statement 2: Yes</b>: <b>Incorrect</b>. There is no rule that moves File2 to the Cool tier on June 1.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Statement 3: Yes</b>: <b>Incorrect</b>. File2 is deleted on June 11, so it cannot be moved to Archive on June 16.<h4><div lova></div>Additional:</h4> - If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management applies the <b>least expensive action to the blob</b>. For example, action delete is cheaper than action tierToArchive. Action tierToArchive is cheaper than action tierToCool.<div lova></div><div lova></div> - If no prefix match is specified, then the policy will apply to all the blobs in the storage account.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
