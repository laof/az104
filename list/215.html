						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><b>D..deleted</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b><div lova></div>All three lifecycle rules are triggered after 5 days, but <b>delete</b> takes precedence over tier changes, so the blob is <b>deleted</b> on June 6.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of other options:</b><div lova></div><b>A..stored in the Cool access tier:</b> The blob would be moved to Cool, but it is deleted by Rule2 before this matters.<div lova></div><b>B..stored in the Archive access tier:</b> The blob would be moved to Archive by Rule3, but is deleted first.<div lova></div><b>C..stored in the Hot access tier:</b> The blob is not retained in Hot; deletion overrides any transition rules.<h4><div lova></div>Additional:</h4>If you define more than one action on the same blob, lifecycle management applies the <b>least expensive action</b> to the blob. For example, <b>action delete is cheaper than action tierToArchive</b>. Action tierToArchive is cheaper than action tierToCool.<div lova></div><div lova></div>When multiple lifecycle management actions are eligible for the same blob at the same time, <b>Azure applies the least expensive action</b> (in terms of storage cost). The priority is: <b>Delete</b> (least expensive), then <b>Archive</b>, then <b>Cool</b>. This means if "delete" is among the actions, delete will be executed over moving the blob to a different tier.</span></div></div></div>
