Therefore, the issue is not with the <b>Allow gateway transit</b> setting. The problem lies with the <b>VPN client configuration</b> on the Windows 10 workstation. Restarting or reinstalling the VPN client configuration is the appropriate next step to resolve the connectivity issue.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> — Incorrect. Since <b>gateway transit</b> is already functioning (as evidenced by successful access from the on-premises network to <b>VirtualNetworkB</b>), enabling it again will not resolve the issue. The root cause is likely a misconfiguration or outdated VPN client setup on the Windows 10 workstation.</span></div></div></div>
