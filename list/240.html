This role includes the <b>Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action</b> and <b>Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/regenerateKey/action</b> permissions, which meet the goal of enabling User1 to list and regenerate storage account keys for <b>storage1</b>.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No: This is incorrect because the Storage Account Key Operator Service Role does provide both list and regenerate permissions for storage account keys, so it meets the requirements stated in the question.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
