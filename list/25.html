						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Correct Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> — This is the correct answer. Setting <b>Allow gateway transit</b> on <b>VirtualNetworkB</b> alone does not enable it to use the VPN gateway in <b>VirtualNetworkA</b>. For gateway transit to work, <b>VirtualNetworkA</b> must have <b>Allow gateway transit</b> enabled, and <b>VirtualNetworkB</b> must have <b>Use remote gateway</b> enabled. The <b>Allow gateway transit</b> setting on <b>VirtualNetworkB</b> is not valid and has no effect.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> — Incorrect. This option misunderstands the configuration. <b>Allow gateway transit</b> is a setting that must be enabled on the network that owns the gateway (<b>VirtualNetworkA</b>), not on the network that wants to use it. To allow <b>VirtualNetworkB</b> to use the gateway in <b>VirtualNetworkA</b>, <b>VirtualNetworkA</b> must allow gateway transit, and <b>VirtualNetworkB</b> must use the remote gateway.</span></div></div></div>
