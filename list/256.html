Creating a storage account and configuring shared access signatures (SASs) is not required for event log monitoring and alerting. The correct way is to <b>install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (or use the Azure Monitor agent)</b>, connect VM1 to Azure Monitor, and <b>create a log alert</b> based on the System event log data collected in Log Analyticsâ€”not by specifying a storage account as the source.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div>Incorrect because specifying a storage account as the source in Azure Monitor does not enable event log-based alerting for VM1. <b>The alert should be based on log data collected in Log Analytics</b>, not storage accounts.</span></div></div></div>
