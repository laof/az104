The supported way is to delete the VM while retaining its disk, then create a new VM in the target VNet (VNet2) and attach the original disk. This minimizes administrative effort and ensures the application is preserved, as discussed earlier.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>First action: Create a network interface in RG2.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because a network interface is permanently associated with its VNet at creation; you cannot attach a NIC from another VNet to an existing VM.</b><div lova></div>First action: Detach a network interface.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because detaching the NIC does not allow you to connect the VM to a different VNet; changing the VNet is not supported after VM creation.</b><div lova></div>First action: Move a network interface to RG2.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because moving a NIC to another resource group does not move it to another VNet; the VNet cannot be changed.</b><div lova></div>Second action: Attach a network interface.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because you cannot attach a NIC from a different VNet to an existing VM; VNets are immutable for NICs and VMs.</b><div lova></div>Second action: Create a network interface in RG2.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because even if you create a new NIC in RG2 (and VNet2), you cannot attach it to the existing VM1 which is bound to VNet1.</b><div lova></div>Second action: Move VM1 to RG2.<div lova></div><b>Incorrect because moving a VM between resource groups does not change its VNet; the VM will still be in the original VNet1.</b></span></div></div></div>
