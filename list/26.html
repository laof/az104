						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Yes</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Correct Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Yes</b> — This is the correct answer. Since the VPN gateway and peering are already configured correctly (as confirmed by successful access from the on-premises network to VirtualNetworkB), the issue likely lies with the <b>VPN client configuration</b> on the Windows 10 workstation. Re-downloading and reinstalling the VPN client ensures that the latest configuration, including updated routes and certificates, is applied, which can resolve the connectivity issue.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. No</b> — Incorrect. This option overlooks the possibility that the VPN client configuration on the Windows 10 workstation may be outdated or misconfigured. Reinstalling the VPN client is a valid and often necessary step to ensure proper routing and connectivity through the VPN.</span></div></div></div>
