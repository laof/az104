						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>A..one <b>virtual machine scale set</b> that has <b>10 virtual machines instances</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> By default, 10 VMs in a scale set with 5 fault domains will be distributed as 2 VMs per fault domain. If one fault domain becomes unavailable, at least 8 VMs remain available. This configuration meets the requirement to ensure App1 always runs on at least eight virtual machines during planned Azure maintenance.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..one Availability Set that has three fault domains and one update domain<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Only one update domain means all VMs could be updated at once, which does not guarantee any VMs remain available during maintenance.<div lova></div><div lova></div>C..one Availability Set that has 10 update domains and one fault domain<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> While 10 update domains help distribute updates, a single fault domain limits resilience against hardware failures and cannot guarantee eight VMs stay available.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D..one virtual machine scale set that has 12 virtual machines instances<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> This option also meets the requirement and provides a larger buffer, but it is not strictly necessary if 10 instances and fault domains already ensure at least 8 VMs are available.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
