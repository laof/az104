						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> Creating an <b>event subscription</b> on VM1 and a generic Azure Monitor alert with VM1 as the source does <b>not</b> meet the goal. To trigger an alert when more than two error events are logged to the System event log within an hour, you must configure <b>Azure Monitor with Log Analytics</b> and set up a <b>Log Analytics workspace</b>, connect VM1, and then create a <b>custom log query alert</b> based on event counts.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Simply creating an event subscription and an Azure Monitor alert on the VM does not provide the logic to track the number of error events within a specific time window. You need Log Analytics and a custom query for this scenario.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
