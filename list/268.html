						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> Moving the virtual machine to a different subscription does <b>not</b> move it to a different physical host; it is only a logical change in Azure's resource structure. To move VM1 to a different host immediately and avoid maintenance impact, you should use the <b>Redeploy</b> feature from the VM's Overview blade, which will move the VM to a new host in the same region.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Changing the subscription does not trigger a redeployment or physical relocation of the VM to a different host. The VM remains on the same underlying infrastructure, so this action does not meet the requirement.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
