						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> Moving <b>VM1</b> to <b>RG2</b> only changes its resource group, not its region. Both the <b>VM</b> and the <b>network interface</b> must be in the same region as the <b>virtual network</b> (<b>VNET2</b> is in East Asia, but <b>VM1</b> is in West US), so this solution does not meet the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> This is incorrect because changing the resource group does not move the VM to a different region, and you cannot connect a VM to a VNet in a different region by simply adding a network interface.<h4><div lova></div>Additional:</h4><div lova></div>When you create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), you must create a Virtual Network (VNet) or use an existing VNet. <b>You can change the subnet</b> a VM is connected to after it's created, but <b>you cannot change the VNet</b>. You can also change the size of a VM.</span></div></div></div>
