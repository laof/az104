						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> Turning off <b>VM1</b> and adding a new network interface does not allow you to connect the VM to <b>VNET2</b> in <b>East Asia</b> because the VM and its network interfaces must be in the same region as the virtual network. Since <b>VM1</b> is in <b>West US</b> and <b>VNET2</b> is in <b>East Asia</b>, this solution will not work.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> This is incorrect because you cannot add a network interface from a VNet in a different region to the VM; the region must match for all resources.</span></div></div></div>
