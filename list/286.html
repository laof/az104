						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Selecting "Programmatic deployment" from the Subscriptions blade shows information about template deployments at the subscription level, but it does not show the specific creation date and time for each resource in RG1. To view the creation date and time for resources deployed via templates in RG1, you should check the deployment history in the <b>"Deployments"</b> section of the RG1 resource group.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
