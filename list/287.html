						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation: </b>You cannot add a network interface from a different region to a VM. VM1 is in "West US" and VNET2 is in "East Asia." Network interfaces must be <b>in the same region as the VM and the virtual network</b>. Therefore, you cannot connect VM1 (West US) to VNET2 (East Asia) by creating a new network interface.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
