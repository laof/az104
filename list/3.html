						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Correct Option: B. No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Explanation: Altering the session control of the Azure AD conditional access policy does not meet the goal because it does not specifically configure the required conditions for Multi-Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device for Global Administrators connecting from untrusted locations.

Yes:</b> This option is incorrect because altering session control alone does not fulfill the requirements of the conditional access policy needed to meet the goal.</span></div></div></div>
