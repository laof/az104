						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/317_2.jpg"><div lova></div><div lova></div>At 9:00 AM, the scale set starts and CPU utilization is 90 percent for 15 minutes. How many virtual machine instances will be running at 9:15 AM? <b>3</b><div lova></div>At 10:00 AM, the scale set has five virtual machine instances running and CPU utilization falls to less than 15 percent for 60 minutes. How many virtual machine instances will be running at 11:00 AM? <b>1</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>3</b> - The initial instance count is 2. CPU usage stays above the 75% scale-out threshold for 15 minutes (longer than the 10-minute duration set), so the scale set increases by 1 VM, resulting in 3 VMs running at 9:15 AM.<div lova></div><b>1</b> - The minimum number of VMs is set to 1. With CPU utilization below the 25% scale-in threshold for 60 minutes (well over the <b>10-minute duration required</b>), the scale set decreases by 1 VM at a time until it reaches the minimum of 1 VM at 11:00 AM.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>2, 4, 5</b> (for the first part) - No scaling occurs at 2 because the CPU threshold is exceeded long enough to trigger a scale out. It only increases by 1 VM per scale action, so not 4 or 5.<div lova></div><b>2, 3, 4</b> (for the second part) - The scale set will continue scaling in, but cannot go below the minimum of 1 VM. Since the decrease is by 1 VM per scale action, it will not remain at higher counts if the low CPU persists.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Default <b>Scale in</b> and <b>Out Default Durations</b> are <b>10 minutes</b> with <b>5 minute cool down</b>.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
