						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> - Running az aks alone in Azure Cloud Shell does not deploy a YAML file to an AKS cluster. The az aks command is used for managing AKS clusters, not for deploying workloads. To deploy a YAML file, you need to use <b>kubectl apply -f filename.yaml</b> after configuring kubectl to connect to the AKS cluster.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> - Incorrect because the az aks command does not apply or deploy YAML manifests to the cluster. You need kubectl for deploying YAML files to AKS.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
