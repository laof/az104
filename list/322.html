						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> – The solution as stated does not meet the goal, because it refers to the "Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension," which is not the correct, current name for the supported monitoring agent in Azure. The correct extension for new deployments is the "Azure Monitor Agent VM extension." Microsoft is deprecating the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) and recommends using the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) and its corresponding extension.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Note:</b> For the most accurate and supported solution, you should use the “Azure Monitor Agent VM extension” to connect the VM to Azure Monitor and the Log Analytics workspace.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
