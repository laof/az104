						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> – Installing the <b>Microsoft Monitoring Agent</b> on <b>VM1</b>, connecting it to a <b>Log Analytics workspace</b>, and creating an alert in <b>Azure Monitor</b> using that workspace as the source will allow you to create an alert when more than two error events are logged to the System event log within an hour. This approach is supported and meets the requirements, even though Microsoft recommends the newer Azure Monitor Agent for new deployments. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is still valid and functional for this scenario.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> – Incorrect because the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) is still supported for use with Log Analytics and Azure Monitor alerts, and the described steps are sufficient to meet the goal. The only scenario where this would be wrong is if the question strictly required the latest agent (Azure Monitor Agent), but the MMA still fulfills the requirements as described.</span></div></div></div>
