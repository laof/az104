In Azure, a resource group is a logical container and can hold resources from any region. The key requirement is that the network interface (NIC2) must be created in the same region as the virtual machine (VM1), which is West US. The resource group (RG1) being in East US does not restrict you from creating resources in West US within it. Therefore, creating NIC2 in RG1 and specifying West US as the region is technically correct and allowed by Azure, and VM1 will be able to use the NIC.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> – Incorrect because the location of the resource group does not limit the regions of resources you deploy within it. As long as NIC2 is created in the West US region, it can be associated with VM1 in West US, regardless of the resource group’s original region.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Multiple NICs allow a VM to connect to different subnets.<div lova></div>VM must have at least one NIC. A virtual machine can have more than one NIC, depending on the size of the VM you create.<div lova></div>Each NIC attached to a VM must <b>exist in the same location and subscription</b> as the VM.<div lova></div>Each NIC must be connected to a VNet that <b>exists in the same Azure location and subscription</b> as the NIC.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
