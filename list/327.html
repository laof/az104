						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> – The solution does not meet the goal because a network interface (NIC) must be created in the same region as the virtual machine (VM1) to which it will be attached. VM1 is located in West US, but the solution attempts to create NIC2 in Central US. This is not allowed, as NIC2 must be in West US to attach to VM1. The resource group (RG2) location does not restrict the NIC's region, but the NIC's region must match the VM.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> – Incorrect because creating NIC2 in Central US does not satisfy the requirement for attaching it to a VM located in West US. The correct approach would be to create NIC2 in West US, regardless of which resource group is chosen.</span></div></div></div>
