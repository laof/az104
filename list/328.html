						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> – The solution meets the goal. In Azure, a resource group is simply a logical container and does not restrict the region of the resources it contains. The important requirement is that the network interface (NIC2) must be created in the same region as the virtual machine (VM1), which is West US. Creating NIC2 in RG2 and specifying West US as the location is valid and supported. RG2's original location (West Europe) does not prevent you from creating resources in other regions within it. As long as NIC2 is in the West US region, it can be attached to VM1.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> – Incorrect because the resource group's location does not limit where the NIC can be created. The correct region for the NIC is West US, matching VM1, regardless of the resource group location.</span></div></div></div>
