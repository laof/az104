This is a required prerequisite for enabling backup operations in App Service.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A _backup.filter file</b> – To exclude specific folders (such as Folder2) from the backup, you use a special file named <b>_backup.filter</b> placed in the app’s directory. This file allows you to specify files and folders that should not be included in the backup.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A Backup vault</b> – This is used for Azure Backup but not for App Service backups; it is not necessary for configuring Web App backups.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A Recovery Services vault</b> – This is also for Azure Backup and not applicable to App Service backups.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A resource group</b> – While a resource group is needed for logical organization, it is not specifically required as the first step for enabling backups.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A backup policy</b> – Backup policies are used in Azure Backup, not for excluding folders in App Service backups.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A lock</b> – Locks prevent deletion or modification of resources and are not used for backup exclusions.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A WebJob</b> – WebJobs are used for running background tasks and are not used for backup configurations or exclusions.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>You need a Recovery service vault if you want to backup VMs, File Shares, SAP HANA in a VM or SQL Server in a VM.<div lova></div>You need a Backup vault if you want to backup Azure Disks, Azure Blobs or Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server.<div lova></div>The question asks about an <b>App Service</b>, this one backs up to a <b>storage account</b>.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
