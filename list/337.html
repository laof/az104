If you receive an error while deploying a container instance due to authentication issues, enabling the Admin user provides credentials that can be used to successfully pull images from the registry.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b>: Incorrect because if the error was due to authentication, enabling the Admin user and using the provided credentials would resolve the issue and allow the deployment to succeed.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
