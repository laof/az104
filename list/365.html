						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right option:</b> <div lova></div><b>B..No</b>AcrPull role to <b>ACR-Tasks-Network</b> only grants pull permissions to that specific identity. To deploy a container instance from Registry1, the identity used by the <b>Azure Container Instance</b> resource must have <b>AcrPull</b> on Registry1, not ACR-Tasks-Network. Therefore, this solution does not meet the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Other options explained:</b> <div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> â€” The solution would only work if the correct identity (used by the container instance) was granted <b>AcrPull</b>. Assigning the role to a different identity does not resolve the deployment error.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
