						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. three virtual hubs and one virtual WAN.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div> — <b>Azure Virtual WAN</b> is a networking service that provides optimized and automated branch connectivity to, and through, Azure. By creating <b>three virtual hubs</b> (one for each datacenter location) and connecting them through a single <b>virtual WAN</b>, you ensure a low-latency, optimized, and scalable network topology. This approach is designed for connecting multiple on-premises sites to Azure and to each other with minimal latency.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Other options explained:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. three Azure Application Gateways and one On-premises data gateway</b> — Incorrect. Application Gateways are used for web traffic load balancing, not for connecting datacenters or minimizing latency.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C. three virtual WANs and one virtual hub</b> — Incorrect. A virtual WAN is a global resource that can contain multiple hubs; creating three WANs with a single hub does not reflect the correct architecture for multi-site connectivity.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D. three On-premises data gateways and one Azure Application Gateway</b> — Incorrect. On-premises data gateways are used for Power BI and other Azure data services, not for network connectivity. Application Gateway does not serve as a WAN or VPN solution.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Virtual WAN:</b> The <b>virtual WAN</b> resource represents a virtual overlay of your Azure network and is a collection of multiple resources. <b>It contains links to all your virtual hubs</b> that you would like to have within the virtual WAN. Virtual WANs are isolated from each other and <b>can't contain a common hub</b>. <b>Virtual hubs in different virtual WANs don't communicate with each other.</b><div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
