						<p class="card-text" id="questionDescription">You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains four subnets named Gateway, Perimeter, NVA, and Production.<div lova></div>The NVA subnet contains two network virtual appliances (NVAs) that will perform network traffic inspection between the Perimeter subnet and the Production subnet.<div lova></div>You need to implement an Azure load balancer for the NVAs. The solution must meet the following requirements:<div lova></div>✑ The NVAs must run in an active-active configuration that uses automatic failover.<div lova></div>✑ The load balancer must load balance traffic to two services on the Production subnet. The services have different IP addresses.<div lova></div>Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.<div lova></div>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<div lova></div></p>

						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B. <b>Deploy a standard load balancer</b><div lova></div>C. <b>Add two load balancing rules that have HA Ports and Floating IP enabled</b><div lova></div>E. <b>Add a frontend IP configuration, a backend pool, and a health probe</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of right options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>B. <b>Deploy a standard load balancer</b> — Standard load balancers support high availability and advanced features like HA Ports and Floating IP, which are required for active-active NVA setups and automatic failover. Basic load balancers do not support these features.<div lova></div><div lova></div>C. <b>Add two load balancing rules that have HA Ports and Floating IP enabled</b> — HA Ports are needed for scenarios requiring all-port load balancing, typical for NVAs. Floating IP enables direct server return, which is required for some NVA architectures and for supporting active-active failover.<div lova></div><div lova></div>E. <b>Add a frontend IP configuration, a backend pool, and a health probe</b> — These are the minimum components for a load balancer to distribute traffic and monitor the health of backend NVAs.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of other options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>A. <b>Deploy a basic load balancer</b> — Incorrect because basic load balancers do not support HA Ports or Floating IP features required for this scenario.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D. <b>Add two load balancing rules that have HA Ports enabled and Floating IP disabled</b> — Incorrect because Floating IP must be enabled for active-active NVA and failover scenarios.<div lova></div><div lova></div>F. <b>Add a frontend IP configuration, two backend pools, and a health probe</b> — Incorrect because you only need one backend pool (both NVAs in the same backend pool) to achieve load balancing across both NVAs.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>You can similarly configure your load balancer to use a load-balancing rule with <b>HA Port</b> with a single front end by setting the <b>Floating IP</b> to <b>Enabled</b>.<div lova></div><div lova></div>With this configuration, you can add more <b>floating IP load-balancing rules</b> and/or a public load balancer. However, you can't use a nonfloating IP, HA-ports load-balancing configuration on top of this configuration.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
