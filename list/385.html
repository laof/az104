(Corrected Order)</h4><div lova></div><div lova></div>Remove peering between VNet1 and VNet2. <b>— First, you must remove the existing peering because peering connections must be removed before you can modify the address space of a virtual network.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Add the 10.33.0.0/16 address space to VNet1. <b>— Second, add the new address space to VNet1 after the peering has been removed. This updates VNet1’s address space as required.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Recreate peering between VNet1 and VNet2. <b>— Finally, re-create the peering so that both VNets are aware of each other's updated address spaces and communication can be restored.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>Remove VNet1. <b>— Incorrect. You do not need to delete the virtual network to add an address space or update peering.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Create a new virtual network named VNet1. <b>— Incorrect. The existing VNet1 should be updated, not recreated.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>On the peering connection in VNet2, allow gateway transit. <b>— Incorrect. Gateway transit is not required for adding address space or updating peering in this scenario.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>On the peering connection in VNet1, allow gateway transit. <b>— Incorrect. Gateway transit is not related to address space or basic peering updates.</b></span></div></div></div>
