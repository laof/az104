						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Correct Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. No</b> — This is the correct answer. The <b>Bulk create user</b> operation in Azure AD is used to create <b>internal users</b> (members), not <b>external guest users</b>. To add external users from a CSV file, you must use the <b>Bulk invite users</b> operation, which sends invitations and creates guest accounts in the directory.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Yes</b> — Incorrect. While the Bulk create user operation supports creating multiple users, it does not support the guest invitation process required for external users. The correct method is <b>Bulk invite users</b>, which is specifically designed for onboarding external (B2B) users.</span></div></div></div>
