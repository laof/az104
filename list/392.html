						<p class="card-text" id="questionDescription">Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<div lova></div>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<div lova></div>You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:<div lova></div>✑ A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1<div lova></div>✑ Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1<div lova></div>✑ A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote Desktop connections<div lova></div>NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.<div lova></div>NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:<div lova></div>✑ Priority: 100<div lova></div>✑ Source: Any<div lova></div>✑ Source port range: *<div lova></div>✑ Destination: *<div lova></div>✑ Destination port range: 3389<div lova></div>✑ Protocol: UDP<div lova></div>✑ Action: Allow<div lova></div>VM1 has a public IP address and is connected to Subnet1. NSG-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is associated to Subnet1.<div lova></div>You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1.<div lova></div>Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 and NSG-VM1 that allows connections from the internet source to the VirtualNetwork destination for port range 3389 and uses the TCP protocol.<div lova></div>Does this meet the goal?<div lova></div></p>

						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. No</b> <div lova></div><div lova></div>This solution does <b>not</b> meet the goal. Adding a rule that allows TCP 3389 from the internet source to the <b>VirtualNetwork</b> destination will not enable RDP from the internet, because "VirtualNetwork" as the destination restricts the rule to traffic within the virtual network. To allow RDP from the internet, the destination must be set to <b>Any</b> or the specific IP of the VM so public internet traffic can reach the VM's public IP on TCP port 3389.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A. Yes <div lova></div><div lova></div>This is incorrect because using "VirtualNetwork" as the destination does <b>not</b> allow inbound traffic from the internet to reach the VM. Internet traffic will be blocked by default unless an explicit rule with destination "Any" or the VM's public IP is used in the NSG.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>The <b>VirtualNetwork destination</b> in an NSG rule refers to allowing traffic to all resources within the VNet where the NSG is applied</span></div></div></div>
