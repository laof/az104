Next, <b>create a VPN gateway</b> in the gateway subnet (this is the Azure endpoint for the VPN tunnel). Then, <b>create a local gateway</b> to represent your on-premises VPN device and its public IP in Azure. Finally, <b>create a VPN connection</b> to link the Azure VPN gateway to the local gateway, establishing the tunnel.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Other options:</b> <b>Create a custom DNS server</b> is not required for a VPN connection and relates to name resolution, not VPN setup. <b>Create an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) profile</b> is unrelated to networking or VPN configuration, and is for global content delivery, not private site-to-site connectivity.</span></div></div></div>
