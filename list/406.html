						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>Solution: You modify the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication policies.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Answer: B. No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Modifying Azure AD authentication policies does not solve the issue because the point-to-site VPN connection is using certificate-based authentication (self-signed certificate), not Azure AD authentication. To allow Computer2 to connect, you must ensure that the client certificate (the same one used by Computer1, or a client certificate generated from the self-signed root certificate) is installed on Computer2. Changing Azure AD policies does not affect certificate-based VPN authentication.<div lova></div><div lova></div>The solution should be <b>export the client certificate from Computer1 and install the certificate on Computer2</b></span></div></div></div>
