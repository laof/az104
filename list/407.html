						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>Solution: You join Computer2 to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Answer: B. No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Joining Computer2 to Azure AD does not allow it to authenticate using a point-to-site VPN connection that requires a self-signed certificate. For certificate-based authentication, the appropriate client certificate (the same one used by Computer1, or a client certificate generated from the self-signed root certificate) must be installed on Computer2. Azure AD join is not required or sufficient for this type of VPN authentication.</span></div></div></div>
