No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> A resource lock in Azure (either Read-only or Delete) is used to prevent resources from being deleted or modified, but it does not apply or enforce any network security rules. To automatically block TCP port 8080 between virtual networks, you would need to configure an NSG rule that denies traffic on port 8080, not a resource lock. Resource locks are not used for security rule enforcement.</span></div></div></div>
