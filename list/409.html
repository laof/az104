						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>D..Start VM1<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> The <b>RDP rule</b> has the highest priority (lowest number, 300), so it is evaluated first and will allow Remote Desktop traffic before the DenyAllInBound rule is processed. Since the NSG rules are correct, the most likely reason for the connection failure is that VM1 is not running. Therefore, you should <b>start VM1</b> to establish a Remote Desktop connection.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Change the priority of the RDP rule<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> The RDP rule already has the highest priority, so changing its priority will not affect the result. The rule is already correctly positioned to allow RDP traffic.<div lova></div>B..Attach a network interface<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> The network interface (vm1173) is already attached to VM1 as shown in the exhibit, so attaching another interface is unnecessary.<div lova></div>C..Delete the DenyAllInBound rule<div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Deleting the DenyAllInBound rule is not required because the RDP rule already permits the necessary traffic before the deny rule is evaluated. Removing DenyAllInBound could reduce security by allowing unwanted inbound traffic.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
