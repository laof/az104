						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/420_1.jpg"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task1:</b> IP flow verify — <b>IP flow verify</b> is designed to identify whether a specific network packet is allowed or denied by security rules (such as NSG rules) and to show which rule is responsible for blocking or allowing that flow. It is the primary tool for determining why a packet isn't reaching an Azure VM.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task2:</b> Connection troubleshoot — <b>Connection troubleshoot</b> (previously known as "Connection monitor") validates outbound connectivity from an Azure VM to an external host by testing and monitoring the connection, which is exactly the requirement for Task2.<div lova></div>It tests the connection at <b>a point in time</b>, rather than monitoring it <b>over time</b>. <div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task1:</b> Next hop — <b>Incorrect:</b> Next hop is used to determine the next hop in the network route from the VM, not to check security rules preventing packet delivery.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task1:</b> Packet capture — <b>Incorrect:</b> Packet capture is used to sniff network traffic for diagnostics, not for identifying security rule blocks.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task1:</b> Security group view — <b>Incorrect:</b> Security group view shows all configured NSG rules but does not simulate network flows or indicate which rule is actively blocking traffic.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task1:</b> Traffic Analytics — <b>Incorrect:</b> Traffic Analytics provides aggregated analysis of network traffic but not detailed security rule-level diagnostics.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task2:</b> IP flow verify — <b>Incorrect:</b> IP flow verify only checks if a single packet flow is allowed or denied based on NSG rules; it doesn't validate end-to-end connectivity or diagnose issues outside NSG scope.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task2:</b> Next hop — <b>Incorrect:</b> Next hop only determines network route next hop, not actual connectivity to external hosts.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task2:</b> NSG flow logs — <b>Incorrect:</b> NSG flow logs provide logging of allowed/denied flows but do not actively validate or troubleshoot connectivity.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Task2:</b> Traffic Analytics — <b>Incorrect:</b> Traffic Analytics is for traffic flow analysis at a high level, not for validating outbound connectivity from a specific VM to an external host.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
