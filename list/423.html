Standard SKU resources (such as Standard Load Balancer) are NOT compatible with Basic SKU public IP addresses; you must use a Standard SKU public IP for association.<div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No: <b>Correct</b> — <b>Standard SKU</b> Load Balancer requires <b>Standard SKU</b> public IPs. Associating a Basic SKU public IP to a VM intended for use with a Standard Load Balancer backend pool will NOT work.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Key Point:</b><div lova></div> - <b>SKU types must match</b> between Azure resources. Mixing Basic and Standard SKUs is not supported for load balancer backend pools.<div lova></div> - You can only attach the VMs that are in <b>the same location</b> and on <b>the same virtual network</b> as the LB.</span></div></div></div>
