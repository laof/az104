						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No — The solution does not meet the goal because <b>VM2</b> has a <b>Basic SKU</b> public IP, which is not compatible with a <b>Standard SKU</b> load balancer; all backend pool members must use <b>Standard SKU</b> public IPs if a public IP is assigned.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes — <b>Incorrect</b>: Although associating a <b>Standard SKU</b> public IP to <b>VM1</b> would make <b>VM1</b> eligible, <b>VM2</b> still has a <b>Basic SKU</b> public IP, which cannot be added to a <b>Standard SKU</b> load balancer backend pool. The SKU types must match for all backend pool resources.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
