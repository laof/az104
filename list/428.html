						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No — <b>Unregistering the Microsoft.ClassicNetwork provider</b> does <b>not</b> meet the goal. This action only prevents the use of classic (legacy) networking resources in Azure. It does not affect the behavior of network security groups (NSGs) or automatically block TCP port 8080 between virtual networks. NSGs and their rules are part of the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) model, not the classic model governed by Microsoft.ClassicNetwork.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Yes — <b>Incorrect</b>: Unregistering the <b>Microsoft.ClassicNetwork</b> provider does not create or enforce any NSG rules, nor does it affect traffic between ARM-based virtual networks. It only disables the ability to create or manage classic networking resources.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>You should <b>use a policy definition</b>.<div lova></div>Resource policy definition used by Azure Policy enables you to establish conventions for resources in your organization by describing when the policy is enforced and what effect to take. By defining conventions, you can control costs and more easily manage your resources.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
