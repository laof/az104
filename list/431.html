						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes:</b> Deleting the <b>BlockAllOther443</b> inbound security rule will allow the <b>Allow_131.107.100.50</b> rule (which allows TCP port 443 from 131.107.100.50) to be effective. Since the deny rule with a higher priority was causing the block, removing it allows the allow rule to take effect and resolves the connection failure.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of the other option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No:</b> This is incorrect because deleting the <b>BlockAllOther443</b> rule will indeed remove the block, and the allow rule for 131.107.100.50 on port 443 will permit the necessary connection.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
