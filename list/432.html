						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B.. No:</b> The "Allow_131.107.100.50" inbound security rule already has the highest priority (100), which means it is processed before any other rule, including "BlockAllOther443" (priority 200). Modifying its priority will not affect the outcome, and thus will not resolve the connection issue. Therefore, this does NOT meet the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of the other option:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A.. Yes:</b> This is incorrect because the priority is already set as high as possible, so further changes to the priority of the allow rule will make no difference.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
