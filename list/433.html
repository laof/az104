The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups.<div lova></div>Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.<div lova></div>You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks.<div lova></div>Solution: You assign a built-in policy definition to the subscription.<div lova></div>Does this meet the goal?<div lova></div></p>

Policies can require that NSGs exist or that certain rules are present, but they <b>cannot</b> directly enforce the block of traffic by themselvesâ€”they require you to specify a policy that audits or denies the absence of such a rule, not the blocking itself.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Therefore, this solution does <b>not</b> meet the goal.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
