Yes:</b> For a <b>Standard SKU</b> (internal) load balancer, virtual machines can only be added to the backend pool if they have a <b>Standard SKU public IP</b> or <b>no public IP</b> at all. <b>VM2</b> currently has a <b>Basic SKU public IP</b>, which is not supported for backend pool membership with a Standard SKU load balancer. By disassociating the public IP address from VM2, both <b>VM1</b> (which already has no public IP) and <b>VM2</b> (after removal) will meet the requirements and can be added to the backend pool.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of the other options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B.. No:</b> This is incorrect because removing the Basic SKU public IP from VM2 is necessary for it to be eligible for the backend pool of a Standard SKU load balancer; otherwise, it cannot be added.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
