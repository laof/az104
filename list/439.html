						<p class="card-text" id="questionDescription">HOTSPOT -<div lova></div>You have an on-premises data center and an Azure subscription. The data center contains two VPN devices. The subscription contains an Azure virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains a gateway subnet.<div lova></div>You need to create a site-to-site VPN. The solution must ensure that if a single instance of an Azure VPN gateway fails, or a single on-premises VPN device fails, the failure will not cause an interruption that is longer than two minutes.<div lova></div>What is the minimum number of public IP addresses, virtual network gateways, and local network gateways required in Azure? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.<div lova></div>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<div lova></div>Hot Area:<div lova></div><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/439_0.jpg"><div lova></div></p>

More than 2 public IPs are unnecessary for a single active-active Azure gateway.<div lova></div><div lova></div>More than 1 virtual network gateway is not needed because a single gateway can be configured for high availability.<div lova></div><div lova></div>More than 1 local network gateway is only required if you have multiple on-premises address spaces or endpoints to represent separately, but for a standard setup with two on-premises devices, a single local network gateway can suffice on the Azure side.</span></div></div></div>
