						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A.. Yes</b> — The first NSG rule already allows client traffic from <b>131.107.100.50</b> on port 443. The problem is that the existing deny rule (priority 200) blocks all other 443 traffic, including the Azure Load Balancer health probe. By adding a new rule (priority 150) that allows traffic from <b>AzureLoadBalancer</b>, you unblock the health probe, allowing the VM to be marked healthy in the backend pool. Once healthy, the load balancer can route allowed client traffic to the VM, since the rule for <b>131.107.100.50</b> already permits it. Therefore, this solution meets the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of the other options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>B.. No — This option is incorrect because the new rule for <b>AzureLoadBalancer</b> at priority 150 specifically fixes the health probe issue, which is the root cause of the connection failure. With the health probe working, the VM remains available for load-balanced client connections that are already allowed by the first NSG rule.</span></div></div></div>
