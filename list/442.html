						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C.. Create a route-based virtual network gateway</b> — Point-to-site (P2S) VPN connections in Azure require a <b>route-based virtual network gateway</b>. Policy-based gateways do not support point-to-site connections. Therefore, you must create a new route-based gateway.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>E.. Delete GW1</b> — Since each virtual network can only have one virtual network gateway, and P2S requires a route-based gateway, you must <b>delete the existing policy-based gateway (GW1)</b> before creating the required route-based gateway.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of the other options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>A.. Add a service endpoint to VNet1 — Service endpoints are used to secure Azure service resources to a virtual network, not for configuring VPN gateways or point-to-site connectivity.<div lova></div><div lova></div>B.. Reset GW1 — Resetting the gateway does not change its type and does not enable point-to-site connections.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D.. Add a connection to GW1 — You cannot add a point-to-site connection to a policy-based gateway. This option is not possible until you have a route-based gateway.<div lova></div><div lova></div>F.. Add a public IP address space to VNet1 — Public IP address spaces are not required or recommended for VPN connections; Azure VNets typically use private address spaces for secure communication.</span></div></div></div>
