						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Azure Network Watcher provides a feature called <b>Packet Capture</b> that allows you to capture network traffic to and from Azure virtual machines. You can set up and configure a packet capture session on <b>VM1</b> (or both VMs) for a specific period (such as three hours) to inspect all network traffic between <b>VM1</b> and <b>VM2</b>. This is the correct solution for the stated requirement.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> â€” This option is incorrect because Azure Network Watcher's packet capture is specifically designed for this purpose and allows you to inspect traffic between VMs as required.</span></div></div></div>
