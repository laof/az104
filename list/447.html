						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Azure Network Watcher's <b>Connection Monitor</b> is designed to monitor connectivity and network performance between two endpoints (such as VM1 and VM2). However, it does not capture or inspect the actual network traffic (packets) between the VMs. To inspect all network traffic, you would need to use the <b>Packet Capture</b> feature instead.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> â€” Incorrect. Connection Monitor cannot inspect or capture the content of network traffic; it only monitors connectivity and performance.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>The connection monitor capability monitors communication at a regular interval and informs you of reachability, latency, and network topology changes between the VM and the endpoint.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Connection monitor also provides the minimum, average, and maximum latency observed over time. After learning the latency for a connection, you may find that you're able to decrease the latency by moving your Azure resources to different Azure regions.</span></div></div></div>
