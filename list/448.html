						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Performance Monitor with a Data Collector Set (DCS) can collect system performance metrics (such as CPU, memory, disk, and network interface statistics), but it does <b>not</b> capture or inspect the actual network traffic (packets) between VM1 and VM2. To inspect all network traffic, you need a packet capture tool such as Azure Network Watcher's Packet Capture feature.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> â€” Incorrect. Performance Monitor cannot capture or inspect the actual contents of network traffic between VMs.</span></div></div></div>
