Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<div lova></div>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<div lova></div>You have an app named App1 that is installed on two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. Connections to App1 are managed by using an Azure Load<div lova></div>Balancer.<div lova></div>The effective network security configurations for VM2 are shown in the following exhibit.<div lova></div><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/451_0.jpg"><div lova></div>You discover that connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443 fail.<div lova></div>You verify that the Load Balancer rules are configured correctly.<div lova></div>You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443.<div lova></div>Solution: You create an inbound security rule that denies all traffic from the 131.107.100.50 source and has a priority of 64999.<div lova></div>Does this meet the goal?<div lova></div></p>

						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>Explanation: The solution proposes to create an inbound security rule that <b>denies all traffic</b> from <b>131.107.100.50</b> with a priority of <b>64999</b>. This will <b>not</b> allow connections from that source IP and will further block the required traffic, rather than permitting it. To allow successful connections, you would need to ensure there is an <b>allow</b> rule for the source and port, not a deny rule.<div lova></div><div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
