There is no evidence of DNS forwarding to Azure Private DNS, so Server2 cannot resolve host2.contoso.com.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Server2 resolves host1.contoso.com to 131.107.10.15: Yes</b> — <b>Server1</b> (10.10.0.4) contains an A record for <b>host1.contoso.com</b> with the value <b>131.107.10.15</b>, so Server2 can resolve this name via its configured DNS.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Server3 resolves host2.contoso.com to 131.107.50.50: No</b> — <b>Server3</b> inherits the DNS server from VNET2, which is set to <b>10.10.0.4</b> (Server1). Server1 does not have a record for host2.contoso.com, and there is no DNS forwarding configured, so Server3 cannot resolve host2.contoso.com.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of other options:</b><div lova></div>Any option marking <b>Server2 resolves host2.contoso.com to 131.107.50.50: Yes</b> or <b>Server3 resolves host2.contoso.com to 131.107.50.50: Yes</b> is incorrect, because both Server2 and Server3 use Server1 (10.10.0.4) as their DNS, and Server1 does not have a record for host2.contoso.com nor is there any evidence of forwarding to the Azure Private DNS zone. Only <b>Server2 resolves host1.contoso.com to 131.107.10.15: Yes</b> is correct, as that record is present in Server1’s DNS.</span></div></div></div>
