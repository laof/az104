						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Answer:</b> B..No<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> Changing the IPSec Policy Agent service Startup type to Automatic on Computer2 does not meet the goal. For a point-to-site VPN connection using a self-signed certificate, you must install the root certificate (that was used to generate the client certificate for Computer1) in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store on Computer2, and install the appropriate client certificate in the Personal store. Setting the IPSec Policy Agent service to Automatic alone does not enable authentication or certificate validation for the VPN connection.</span></div></div></div>
