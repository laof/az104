						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/470_4.jpg"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>VM3 can establish a network connection to VM1.</b> Yes<div lova></div><b>If VM3 is turned off, VM2 can establish a network connection to VM1.</b> No<div lova></div><b>VM1 can establish a network connection to VM2.</b> Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> <div lova></div>VM3 acts as a router (virtual appliance) between Subnet1 and Subnet2 because IP forwarding is enabled on its NIC and routing is enabled at the OS level; route table RT1 sends all traffic between Subnet1 and Subnet2 through VM3, so as long as VM3 is running and properly configured, traffic between VM1 and VM2 will be routed via VM3â€”if VM3 is off, no connectivity is possible between those subnets.</span></div></div></div>
