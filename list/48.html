VM1, storage1, VNET1, and VM1Managed only — These resources are eligible to be moved between subscriptions within the same tenant.

VM1 and VM1Managed only — Incorrect because storage1 and VNET1 can also be moved. <div lova></div> C. VM1, storage1, VNET1, VM1Managed, and RVAULT1 — Incorrect because Recovery Services vaults (RVAULT1) cannot be moved across subscriptions. <div lova></div> D. RVAULT only — Incorrect because Recovery Services vaults are not supported for subscription moves.<h4><div lova></div>Azure Services That Can't Be Moved Across Subscriptions:</h4> Recovery Services vaults, Azure AD Domain Services, diagnostic settings, support providers, AD Hybrid Health Service components, Azure Advisor configurations, certain alert types, API Management in Consumption SKU, App Service components like apiapps and gateways, HDInsight cluster networking resources, and any child resources whose parent cannot be moved [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources).</span></div></div></div>
