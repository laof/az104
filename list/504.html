						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..a resource guard</b> — To enable multi-user authorization (MAU) for a Recovery Services vault, you must first create a resource guard. The resource guard is used to enforce additional authorization requirements for critical operations.<div lova></div><div lova></div>---------------------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..an administrative unit — Administrative units are for organizing Azure AD resources and access management, but are not involved in enabling MAU for Recovery Services vaults.<div lova></div>B..a managed identity — Managed identities allow Azure resources to authenticate to services, but are not used to enable MAU for vaults.<div lova></div>D..a custom Azure role — Custom roles define permissions, but enabling MAU specifically requires a resource guard to authorize critical operations.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Resource Guard is an Azure feature that helps <b>protect critical resources</b>, such as Recovery Services Vaults and Backup Vaults, from unauthorized modifications. It does this by adding an extra layer of authorization to critical operations.<div lova></div>Resource Guard works by associating a vault with a Resource Guard. When you try to perform a critical operation on the vault, Azure first checks to see if you have the appropriate permissions on the Resource Guard. If you do not have the appropriate permissions, the operation will fail.<div lova></div>Creating a Resource Guard is a simple process that can be done in the Azure portal. You can create a Resource Guard in the same subscription or a different subscription as the vault you want to protect.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
