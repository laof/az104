						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b><div lova></div><div lova></div> â€” The root cause is that the health probe traffic from the Azure Load Balancer is blocked by the second rule (priority 200, "BlockAllOther443"). By creating an inbound security rule that allows any traffic from the AzureLoadBalancer source with a priority of 150, the health probe will succeed. Once the health probe works, the Load Balancer will mark the VM as healthy and forward external connections (including from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443) to the VM, so the issue will be resolved.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
