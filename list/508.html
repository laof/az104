						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><img src="img/508_3.png"><div lova></div><div lova></div>Virtual network: <b>VNet3 only</b><div lova></div> — <b>VNet1</b> does not have enough contiguous address space for a new /23 subnet, and <b>VNet2</b> has all its address space already allocated to two /17 subnets. Only <b>VNet3</b> (172.16.0.0/16) has sufficient unallocated address space to create a new /23 subnet as required by Azure Container Apps' minimum subnet size.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Subnet mask: <b>/23</b><div lova></div> — Azure Container Apps requires a minimum subnet size of /23 to support integration and scaling; this provides enough IP addresses for infrastructure and scale-out scenarios.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>Virtual network: VNet1 only — <b>VNet1</b> only has 10.1.129.0/24 free, which is not enough for a /23 subnet. VNet2 only — <b>VNet2</b> has its entire address space allocated; no space is left for another subnet. VNet1 or VNet2 only — Neither has enough space for a /23 subnet. VNet2 or VNet3 only — <b>VNet2</b> cannot support a new /23 subnet, only <b>VNet3</b> can. VNet1 or VNet3 only — <b>VNet1</b> cannot support the required subnet size, only <b>VNet3</b> can. VNet1, VNet2, or VNet3 — Only <b>VNet3</b> meets the requirements, so this option is too broad.<div lova></div>Subnet mask: /16 — Larger than required and wastes address space; not needed for Container Apps. /23 — <b>Correct, meets minimum requirement.</b> /24 — Not sufficient, as it does not meet the Azure minimum subnet size for Container Apps. /26 and /28 — Much too small to support Container Apps infrastructure and scaling needs.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
