						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div>B: <b>3</b> — <b>Azure Bastion</b> must be deployed in each Azure region where you want to provide secure RDP/SSH connectivity through Bastion. Since all VNets are peered (including global peering, which connects VNets across regions), this enables communication between VNets in different regions. <b>However, Bastion hosts cannot be shared across regions</b> even with global peering. You still need one Bastion host per Azure region. The table lists three regions: <b>US East</b>, <b>UK South</b>, and <b>Asia East</b>, so the minimum number of Bastion hosts required is 3.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A: 1 — Incorrect, because Bastion cannot span multiple Azure regions; you need one per region even if VNets are globally peered.<div lova></div>C: 9 — Incorrect, as this would imply more than one Bastion per region, which is unnecessary due to VNet peering.<div lova></div>D: 10 — Incorrect, as this would mean deploying a Bastion in every VNet, which is not required because peered VNets in the same region (and across regions with global peering) can share a single Bastion, but <b>not</b> across regions.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
