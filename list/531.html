						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D..Copy Budget.xls to Data.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> is the correct answer because when restoring a VM from an Azure Backup using the "Replace existing" option, the VM is reverted to the state it was in at the time of the backup; any files or data added after the backup, such as Budget.xls, will not be present and must be recopied to the VM after restore.<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Other Options</h4><b>A..Modify the size of VM1</b> is an Azure-level configuration that can be reapplied at any time and is not directly related to the data or state of the VM disks restored from backup.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..Reset the password for the built-in administrator account</b> is a configuration change that will revert to the password set at backup time, but it can be reset again easily after restore.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..Add a data disk</b> refers to adding disks after backup; if the disk was not present at backup time, it will not be in the restored VM, but the primary focus of the question is on the specific file copy (option D) rather than hardware configuration.</span></div></div></div>
