Increasing this limit allows User1 to join additional devices.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Assign the User administrator role to User1</b> is incorrect because joining devices to Azure AD does not require administrative privileges; any user can join devices as long as policy allows.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..Create a point-to-site VPN from the home network of User1 to Azure</b> is incorrect because joining devices to Azure AD is an internet-based process and does not require VPN connectivity to the corporate network.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D..From the Device settings blade, modify the Users may join devices to Azure AD setting</b> is incorrect because if User1 was able to join devices in the past, this setting is already enabled for the user or group.</span></div></div></div>
