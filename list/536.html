						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b> <h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Right Option</h4> When <b>User1</b> creates a new Azure Active Directory tenant (<b>external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com</b>), they are automatically assigned the <b>Global administrator</b> role in that tenant. As a Global administrator, <b>User1</b> has full permissions to create new user accounts in the new tenant, so instructing <b>User1</b> to create user accounts does meet the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b> This is incorrect because <b>User1</b>, as the Global administrator of the new tenant, has all the necessary rights to create user accounts. No additional role assignment or configuration is required for this permission.</span></div></div></div>
