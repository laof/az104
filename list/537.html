NPM provides end-to-end network monitoring capabilities, which is exactly what's needed for monitoring latency.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Service Map</b> This tool visualizes dependencies between VMs and services but does not provide direct network latency measurements between on-premises and Azure VMs.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..Connection troubleshoot</b> This is used for troubleshooting specific connection issues and testing connectivity but is not suitable for continuous latency monitoring.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D..Effective routes</b> This feature shows the routes that are being used by a network interface but does not monitor latency or network performance.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Additional:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>Network Watcher is a Suite of tools offering but not limited to the following: - <b>Connection Monitor</b> - latency and network issues with IaaS devices over a <b>PERIOD OF TIME</b><div lova></div> - <b>Connection troubleshoot</b> - latency and network issues with IaaS devices <b>ONE-TIME</b><div lova></div> - <b>IP Flow</b> - latency and network issues at the <b>VM LEVEL</b><div lova></div> - <b>Network Performance Monitor</b> - latency and network issues in hybrid, <b>ON-PREM</b>, across environments.</span></div></div></div>
