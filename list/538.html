The average CPU percentage is calculated [four times] per day.</b><h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Right Option</h4>The chart is set to "Automatic - 6 hours," meaning the CPU percentage is aggregated every <b>6 hours</b>. Since there are 24 hours in a day, this results in the average CPU percentage being calculated <b>four times</b> per day (24 ÷ 6 = 4).<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>2. ASP1 must be [scaled up] to optimize CPU usage.</b><h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Right Option</h4>The maximum CPU percentage frequently reaches <b>100%</b>, indicating that the current App Service Plan is under-provisioned. To optimize CPU usage and avoid performance issues, <b>scaling up</b> (increasing the plan’s resources) is required.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>once, six times, 24 times</b> These options are incorrect because, with a 6-hour aggregation, the average is not calculated once, six times, or 24 times per day.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>scaled down</b> This would reduce available resources and worsen performance, not optimize CPU usage.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>scaled out</b> Scaling out adds more instances, but since each instance would still hit 100% CPU, the best solution is to scale up.</span></div></div></div>
