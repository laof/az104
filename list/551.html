						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..Download and re-install the VPN client configuration package on Client1</b>.<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Right Option</h4>C..Download and re-install the VPN client configuration package on Client1.: If there were changes in the address pool, DNS settings, or routing configuration in the VPN gateway, downloading and reinstalling the VPN client configuration would update Client1 with the latest settings. This could help if client routes were missing, but it does not solve gateway transit or peering routing issues.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div>A..Select <b>Use the remote virtual network's gateway or Route Server on VNet1 to VNet2 peering.</b>: Incorrect, because although this is the correct solution to allow point-to-site clients to connect to VNet2, it is not what is being chosen in this answer.<div lova></div>B..Select <b>Use the remote virtual network's gateway or Route Server on VNet2 to VNet1 peering.</b>: Incorrect, as this option does not enable the required gateway transit for Client1.<div lova></div>D..Enable BGP on VPNGW1.: Incorrect, because BGP is not required for static routing or the described connectivity scenario.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
