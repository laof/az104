Since March 1 is the scheduled yearly backup date, the backup on Sunday, March 1, will be retained for 10 years.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>36 months</b>: The policy retains monthly backup points for 36 months. November 1 is the first day of the month and is a monthly backup, so the backup on Sunday, November 1, will be retained for 36 months.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>30 days</b>: This is the retention for daily backup points, but March 1 and November 1 match longer retention (yearly/monthly) according to the policy and thus are not retained for just 30 days.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>10 weeks</b>: This is the retention for weekly backup points, but since the backups in question coincide with monthly/yearly retention schedules, they are kept longer per the policy.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
