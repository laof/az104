						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C. an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> To ensure that all <b>virtual machines</b> only communicate with <b>Azure Monitor</b> through <b>VNet1</b>, you must first create an <b>Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)</b>. This scope allows you to configure <b>private endpoints</b> for Azure Monitor, so that monitoring traffic remains within your virtual network and is not exposed to the public internet.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Other Options Explanation</h4><b>A. a data collection rule (DCR):</b> DCRs define what data to collect and where to send it, but do not control network access or restrict traffic to a specific VNet.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B. a Log Analytics workspace:</b> This is required to store monitoring data, but it does not enforce network-level communication restrictions for Azure Monitor traffic.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D. a private endpoint:</b> A private endpoint is used to connect services privately, but it must be linked to an <b>AMPLS</b> first. Thus, the <b>AMPLS</b> must be created before configuring the private endpoint.<h4><div lova></div>Difference Between <b>Azure Private Link</b> and <b>Private Endpoint</b></h4><b>Azure Private Link</b> is a service that enables you to access Azure services (such as Azure Storage, SQL Database, or your own services) privately over a private network, effectively bringing the service into your own VNet.<div lova></div><b>Private Endpoint</b> is a specific network interface with a private IP address from your VNet, created as part of Private Link, which is used to connect privately to the Azure service.<div lova></div><h4><div lova></div>Other</h4><b>Azure Private Link</b> provides the overall capability for private connectivity, while a <b>Private Endpoint</b> is the actual resource (network interface) that enables this private connection for a specific service instance.<div lova></div>You use <b>Private Link</b> to enable private connectivity, and <b>Private Endpoint</b> is the technical implementation of that connectivity within your VNet.<div lova></div></span></div></div></div>
