						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><img class="in-exam-image" src="img/585_1.png"><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Users may join devices to Azure AD</b><div lova></div><b>Require Multi-Factor Auth to join devices</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanations of Right Options</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Users may join devices to Azure AD:</b> This setting determines who can join devices to Azure AD. Modifying this allows you to control device enrollment and ensure only authorized users can join devices, which is often required to meet security and user requirements.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Require Multi-Factor Auth to join devices:</b> Enabling this setting increases security by requiring users to perform MFA when joining a device to Azure AD, meeting technical and security requirements.<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Other Options</h4><b>Additional local administrators on Azure AD joined devices:</b> This controls which users will be added as local admins on the machines, but it is not directly related to the device join or registration process for most security or onboarding requirements.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Users may register their devices with Azure AD:</b> Device registration is usually for personal device scenarios (BYOD) and is not the same as joining a device to Azure AD, which is more relevant for organizational devices.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Maximum number of devices per user:</b> This limits how many devices a single user can join, but does not fundamentally change the core process or security for device joining itself. It is a quota control rather than a security or enablement setting.</span></div></div></div>
