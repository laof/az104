						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Question 2-19</h4><b>Correct Answer: B..No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> The <b>Logic App Operator</b> role allows users to <b>read, enable, disable, and run</b> logic apps, but it does <b>not</b> grant permissions to <b>create or edit</b> logic apps. To meet the goal of allowing the Developers group to create logic apps, a role like <b>Logic App Contributor</b> or <b>Contributor</b> is required.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Yes</b>: Incorrect. The <b>Logic App Operator</b> role does not include permissions to create or modify logic apps, so it does not meet the goal.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..No</b>: Correct. Since the assigned role does not allow creation of logic apps, the solution does not meet the goal.</span></div></div></div>
