Policy2 applies to WebApp1.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> When you move a <b>Web App</b> to a different <b>resource group</b> within the same subscription, the <b>App Service plan</b> and its <b>region</b> remain unchanged. However, the <b>policy</b> applied to the new resource group (in this case, <b>Policy2</b> from RG2) will now apply to the Web App.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..The App Service plan for WebApp1 remains in West Europe. Policy2 applies to WebApp1.</b>: Correct. The region stays the same, but the policy changes to that of the new resource group.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..The App Service plan for WebApp1 moves to North Europe. Policy2 applies to WebApp1.</b>: Incorrect. The App Service plan does not move regions when the app is moved between resource groups.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..The App Service plan for WebApp1 remains in West Europe. Policy1 applies to WebApp1.</b>: Incorrect. Policy1 is associated with RG1. After the move to RG2, Policy2 applies.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D..The App Service plan for WebApp1 moves to North Europe. Policy1 applies to WebApp1.</b>: Incorrect. Neither the region changes nor does the original policy remain after the move.<h4><div lova></div>Process for Moving a Web App Between Resource Groups in Azure</h4><b>1.

Select Target Resource Group</b>: Choose the destination resource group (e.g., RG2) from the dropdown list.<div lova></div><b>5.

Confirm and Execute</b>: Click <b>OK</b> to confirm and start the move operation.<div lova></div><b>7. Wait for Completion</b>: The move process may take a few minutes. Once complete, the web app will appear under the new resource group.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Important Notes:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>- The <b>App Service plan</b> and <b>region</b> do not change during the move.<div lova></div><div lova></div>- The <b>policy</b> of the new resource group (e.g., Policy2 in RG2) will apply to the web app after the move.<div lova></div><div lova></div>- Some resources cannot be moved if they are linked to services that do not support resource group moves.</span></div></div></div>
