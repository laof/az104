						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Question 2-30</h4><b>Correct Answer: C..Assign the Global administrator role to User1, and then instruct User1 to configure access management for Azure resources.</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> To assign a policy at the <b>tenant root management group</b> level, the user must have access to manage that scope. By default, only users with the <b>Global administrator</b> role in Azure AD can elevate their access to manage all Azure resources, including the tenant root group. Once User1 is a Global admin, they can enable <b>Access management for Azure resources</b> in Azure AD, which allows them to assign policies at the root level.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A..Assign the Owner role for the Azure Subscription to User1, and then modify the default conditional access policies.</b>: Incorrect. The Owner role at the subscription level does not grant permissions at the tenant root management group level.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>B..Assign the Owner role for the Azure subscription to User1, and then instruct User1 to configure access management for Azure resources.</b>: Incorrect. This still limits User1 to the subscription scope, not the tenant root.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C..Assign the Global administrator role to User1, and then instruct User1 to configure access management for Azure resources.</b>: Correct. This allows User1 to elevate their access and manage policies at the tenant root level.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D..Create a new management group and delegate User1 as the owner of the new management group.</b>: Incorrect. This only gives User1 access to the new group, not the tenant root management group.</span></div></div></div>
