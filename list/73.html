						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Question 2-33</h4><b>Correct Answer:</b> B. No – <b>The Network Contributor role</b> allows managing network resources but does <b>not grant access to Log Analytics</b>, which is required to enable Traffic Analytics. To meet the goal, Admin1 needs a role like <b>Log Analytics Contributor</b> or <b>Reader</b> on the Log Analytics workspace.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Yes</b> – Incorrect. While the <b>Network Contributor</b> role allows managing network-related resources such as NSGs, it does <b>not provide permissions to configure or access Log Analytics</b>, which is essential for enabling Traffic Analytics. Therefore, this role alone is insufficient.</span></div></div></div>
