						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Question 2-35</h4><b>Correct Answer:</b> B. No – The <b>Reader role</b> at the subscription level provides read-only access to resources but does <b>not grant sufficient permissions</b> to configure or enable <b>Traffic Analytics</b>. Admin1 would need additional permissions, particularly on the <b>Log Analytics workspace</b> and network resources.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Yes</b> – Incorrect. The <b>Reader role</b> only allows viewing resources and does <b>not allow making changes</b> or enabling features like Traffic Analytics. It lacks the necessary permissions to configure network monitoring or analytics settings.</span></div></div></div>
