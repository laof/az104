						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Question 2-39</h4><b>Correct Answer:</b> B. Remove the resource lock from VNET1 and delete all data in Vault1 – <b>Resource locks</b> prevent deletion, so the <b>Delete lock on VNET1</b> must be removed first. Additionally, <b>Recovery Services Vaults</b> like Vault1 must be emptied (i.e., all backup items deleted) before the vault and the resource group can be deleted.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation of Other Options:</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>A. Modify the backup configurations of VM1 and modify the resource lock type of VNET1</b> – Incorrect. Modifying backup settings does not remove existing backup data, and changing the lock type still prevents deletion unless it's removed.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>C. Turn off VM1 and remove the resource lock from VNET1</b> – Incorrect. Turning off VM1 is unnecessary for deletion, and this option does not address the need to delete backup data in Vault1.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>D. Turn off VM1 and delete all data in Vault1</b> – Incorrect. This does not address the <b>Delete lock on VNET1</b>, which will still prevent the deletion of the resource group.</span></div></div></div>
