						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Correct Answer:</h4>B..The <b>user principal name</b> of each user only<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Correct Option:</h4>The <b>user principal name (UPN)</b> is the unique identifier for a user in Azure Active Directory. When performing a bulk delete operation, Azure AD requires only the UPN to identify and delete the user accounts. Other attributes like display name or usage location are not necessary for this operation.<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Other Options:</h4>A..The <b>user principal name and usage location</b> of each user only — <b>Incorrect</b> because usage location is not required for deletion; only the UPN is needed.<div lova></div><div lova></div>C..The <b>display name</b> of each user only — <b>Incorrect</b> because display names are not unique and cannot reliably identify users for deletion.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D..The <b>display name and usage location</b> of each user only — <b>Incorrect</b> for the same reasons as above; neither attribute is sufficient or required for deletion.<div lova></div><div lova></div>E..The <b>display name and user principal name</b> of each user only — <b>Incorrect</b> because while UPN is required, display name is unnecessary and not used in the bulk delete process.</span></div></div></div>
