No policy applies additional tags to RG1, and Azure does not inherit tags from parent resources by default.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</h4><b>storage1</b> has <b>Tag3:value1</b> directly assigned. Although it is within the scope of the policy that appends <b>Tag4:value4</b>, the policy only affects new or modified resources. Since there's no indication that storage1 was created or modified after the policy was applied or that remediation was run, it would not have <b>Tag4:value4</b>. Also, Azure does not automatically inherit <b>Tag1:subscription</b> or <b>Tag2:IT</b> from parent resources.<div lova></div><div lova></div><b>VNET1</b> has <b>Tag3:value2</b> directly assigned. It is explicitly excluded from the policy, so it does not receive <b>Tag4:value4</b>. Like storage1, it does not inherit <b>Tag2:IT</b> from RG1 unless a separate inheritance policy is in place, which is not mentioned.</span></div></div></div>
