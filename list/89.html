To enable Traffic Analytics, the user needs permissions related to <b>Network Watcher</b> and <b>Log Analytics</b>, such as the <b>Network Contributor</b> or a custom role with specific permissions.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Incorrect Option:</h4>A.. <b>Yes</b> â€” <b>Incorrect</b> because the <b>Traffic Manager Contributor</b> role is unrelated to Traffic Analytics. It only allows managing DNS-based traffic routing via Traffic Manager, not network monitoring or analytics features.</span></div></div></div>
