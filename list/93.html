						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Correct Answer:</h4>B.. <b>Assign User1 the Owner role for VNet1</b><div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Correct Option:</h4>The <b>Owner</b> role includes all permissions of the <b>Contributor</b> role plus the ability to <b>manage role assignments</b> (i.e., assign roles to other users). To allow User1 to assign the <b>Reader</b> role for VNet1 to others, they must have <b>Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write</b> permission, which is included in the <b>Owner</b> role.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</h4>A.. <b>Remove User1 from the Security Reader role for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for RG1</b> — <b>Incorrect</b> because the Contributor role does not allow managing role assignments.<div lova></div><div lova></div>C.. <b>Assign User1 the Contributor role for VNet1</b> — <b>Incorrect</b> because Contributor can manage resources but cannot assign roles.<div lova></div><div lova></div>D.. <b>Assign User1 the Network Contributor role for VNet1</b> — <b>Incorrect</b> because this role allows managing network resources but not role assignments.<h4><div lova></div>Additional:</h4>Owner = Grants <b>full access to manage all resources</b>, including the ability to <b>assign roles in Azure RBAC</b>.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Contributor = Grants <b>full access to manage all resources</b>, but does <b>NOT</b> allow you to <b>assign roles in Azure RBAC</b>. (you cannot add users or change their rights)<div lova></div><div lova></div>User Access Administrator = Lets you <b>manage user access to Azure resources</b>.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Reader = <b>View all resources</b>, but does not allow you to make any changes.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Security Admin = <b>View and update permissions for Security Center</b>. Same permissions as the Security Reader role and can also update the security policy and dismiss alerts and recommendations.<div lova></div><div lova></div>Network Contributor = Lets you <b>manage networks</b>, but not access to them. (so you can add VNET, subnet, etc)</span></div></div></div>
