						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Correct Answer:</h4>B.. <b>No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> User2 is a <b>Global Administrator</b> in the original tenant (<b>contoso.onmicrosoft.com</b>), but that role does not automatically apply to the new tenant (<b>external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com</b>). Each Azure AD tenant is isolated, and roles must be explicitly assigned per tenant. Therefore, unless User2 is also assigned a role like <b>Global Administrator</b> in the new tenant, they cannot create user accounts there.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Other Option:</h4>A.. Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div>This is incorrect because being a Global Administrator in one tenant does not grant permissions in another tenant. User2 would need to be assigned the appropriate role in the <b>external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com</b> tenant to perform user management tasks.</span></div></div></div>
