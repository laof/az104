						<span class="correct-answer-box"><strong>Suggested Answer:</strong></span><span class="answer-description"><h4><div lova></div>Correct Answer:</h4>&gt;B.. <b>No</b><div lova></div><div lova></div><b>Explanation:</b> User4 is an <b>Owner</b> at the <b>Azure Subscription</b> level, which grants permissions to manage resources within that subscription, but not within <b>Azure Active Directory</b>. Creating user accounts is a directory-level task, which requires roles like <b>Global Administrator</b> or <b>User Administrator</b> in the specific Azure AD tenant. Since User4 has no role in the new tenant (<b>external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com</b>), they cannot create user accounts there.<div lova></div><div lova></div>-----------------<h4><div lova></div>Other Option:</h4>A.. Yes<div lova></div><div lova></div>This is incorrect because subscription-level roles like <b>Owner</b> do not grant permissions to manage Azure AD users. Directory-level roles are required for user creation in Azure AD.</span></div></div></div>
